This was made over summer 2000, more or less. Having just learned programming the year before, the ideas were all still a big
stew brewing in my head, so with [Pointers on C](http://www.amazon.com/Pointers-C-Kenneth-Reek/dp/0673999866) in hand, I tried
to throw together a little text mode project to get them all settled. (I definitely learn best by doing...)

Supposedly the game was to be an RPG of some sort, but I never got that far. :P Much of it is rather cringe-worthy, I imagine,
but it did have the intended effect of teasing all the concepts out. Also, as with many of my projects, it randomly devolved
into a testbed for unrelated ideas (e.g. the rotating cube stuff). :)
